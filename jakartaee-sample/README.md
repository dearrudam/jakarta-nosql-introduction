# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). 


Starts the MongoDB instance:
```
docker-compose -f ./../mongodb.yaml up -d
```

Run the project in DEV mode
```
    mvn liberty:dev
```
Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:9080.
